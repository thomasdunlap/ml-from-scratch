# Machine Learning From Scratch

Reinforcing my knowledge of ML algorithms by coding them in Python, TensorFlow, C++, and maybe C if I get extra adventurous.  Do you need to code in anything but Python to do Machine Learning or Data Science?  No. Using C/C++ forces you to learn more about the inner workings of computers, and I'm the kind of weirdo who thinks that's "neat!".
